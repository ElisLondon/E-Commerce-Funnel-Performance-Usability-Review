## **Introduction**

Our start-up launched a new e commerce website in January, building on the customer base established over the previous year. As part of our development strategy, we analysed the first four months of customer click through behaviour to identify problem areas and assess performance against industry benchmarks. The analysis focused on click through rates (CTRs) across key funnel stages, tracking changes over time and examining the influence of device type and gender on user progression.


## **Executive Summary**

<img width="940" height="519" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/689d06fb-d5b1-4670-aed6-f61ea66f0074" />

Between January and April, our website experienced persistently low click-through rates (CTR), averaging 0.8% in Jan–Feb before declining further to 0.2% in Mar–Apr. This performance is well below the industry benchmark of 2.7%, underscoring a broader need for CTR improvement beyond the March decline.

### **Key Findings**
1.	Conversion funnel attrition: Only 0.5% of users completed a purchase, with steep drop-offs at each stage:
  - 50% from home → search
  - 13% from search → payment
  - 7% from payment → confirmation
2.	Mobile search breakdown: Engagement fell from 80% to 20% in March, driving the overall CTR decline.
3.	Desktop payment drop-off: CTR from search to payment fell from 15% to 4%, indicating checkout friction.
4.	Demographics stable: Gender distribution remained consistent across stages, with slightly higher purchase completion among females.
  - These trends suggest potential usability issues in mobile search and declining product satisfaction, alongside friction in the desktop payment journey. Without intervention, both CTR and conversion rates risk continued underperformance.

### **Recommended Actions**
#### Immediate priorities
- Audit and optimize mobile search functionality.
- Streamline the desktop payment journey to reduce friction.
- Test targeted promotions to strengthen product appeal.

#### Longer-term initiatives
- Implement demographic segmentation to tailor engagement strategies.
- Optimize the funnel to raise purchase conversion to at least 1%.
- Stabilize CTR across devices to align with industry benchmarks.


## **Insights deep dive**

### CTR for each step decreased along the purchase process
<img width="940" height="186" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/483b7d0a-5169-4688-bc75-816041d7e5b9" />

<img width="940" height="268" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c4e78960-3556-4f3d-840f-9638cd0c2fe8" />

- Purchase Completion Remains Critically Low – Only 0.5% of visitors completed a purchase, highlighting significant funnel inefficiencies compared to industry norms.
- Severe Drop-Off in Checkout Conversion – Just 7% of users who reached the payment page completed confirmation, indicating friction in the payment process.
  - Audit and streamline checkout to remove unnecessary steps and barriers.
- Weak Transition from Search to Payment – Only 13% of users progressed from search to payment, suggesting dissatisfaction with product offerings or pricing.
  - Test promotional campaigns to boost appeal and investigate potential stock or assortment issues.
- High Attrition Before Search Engagement – Half of visitors abandoned before reaching the search page, limiting downstream conversion potential.
  - Collect demographic data to identify audience-specific barriers for improvements. Aim to raise CTR at this stage by 10% to strengthen the funnel overall.

#### Strategic Implications:
- Funnel leakage is occurring at multiple stages, with the most critical issues at search engagement and payment completion.
- Addressing mobile search usability, product appeal, and checkout friction will deliver the fastest impact.
- Longer-term, demographic segmentation and targeted optimization can stabilize CTR and lift purchase conversion above 1%.

## **How have CTRs changed over time?**

<img width="940" height="506" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b70db0f5-08ef-4a85-9cf4-63a97431b32a" />

- Home → Search Drop-Off (March) CTR declined from 60% to 40%, representing a monthly loss of 5,000 users – this sharp decline points to potential website usability issues or changes in the search experience.
  - Audit recent site updates or layout changes for unintended friction.
  - Conduct usability testing to identify barriers in the search entry point.
  - Restore CTR to 60%, which aligns with competitor benchmarks.
- Search → Payment Decline CTR fell from 18% to 7%, equating to a monthly loss of 2,000 users – A CTR of 18% is already below the target minimum of 25%, and the March decline suggests checkout friction or pricing dissatisfaction.
  - Partner with product teams to highlight popular items and adjust promotions.
  - Introduce offers and bundles directly on the search screen to increase appeal.
  - Use heatmaps, A/B testing, and cart abandonment analysis to pinpoint usability issues.
  - Investigate potential bugs, confusing layouts, or excessive checkout steps.
- Overall Funnel Impact Combined reductions in home → search and search → payment drove overall CTR down from 0.8% to 0.2% in March; since CTR from payment → confirmation remained stable across Jan–Apr, the root cause lies within site functionality and product experience, not external factors.
  - Prioritize fixes to search usability and checkout flow.
  - Monitor funnel health monthly to ensure CTR stabilizes and aligns with industry benchmarks.

## **What Affect Did Device Type and Gender Have?**

### Device Type
Desktop Users Dominate Traffic Two-thirds of all visitors accessed via desktop, making this segment the primary driver of overall site performance. 
Despite Desktop users dominating traffic, mobile users placed 67% of orders

<img width="432" height="223" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9f1674ae-ee38-4b22-8760-9a834354e358" />

#### Home -> Search Drop

<img width="940" height="498" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/87336bcd-7054-413a-bfb5-b67c27819c00" />

- Mobile Search Engagement Collapse (March) CTR from home → search among mobile users fell sharply from 80% in Jan–Feb to 20% in Mar–Apr, while desktop CTR remained steady at 50%.
  - This indicates a mobile-specific issue introduced in March.
- The decline was device-driven, not universal: desktop remained stable, while mobile experienced a sudden breakdown.
  - The timing suggests either technical malfunctions, reduced marketing investment, or competitive disruption.

#### Recommended Actions:
- Investigate potential bugs, indexing errors, or broken links introduced in March.
- Review app and mobile browser compatibility to detect malfunctions.
- Assess whether mobile ad spend or promotions decreased in March.
- Monitor whether competitors launched app upgrades or new promotions in March.
- Consider counter-promotions or feature enhancements to restore engagement.

#### Search -> Payment Drop Off
<img width="940" height="515" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a4850708-e827-47b0-82a3-67373c16bc58" />

- Desktop Checkout Friction (March) CTR from search → payment dropped sharply from 16% to 4%, representing a major loss in purchase intent among desktop users. → This signals significant friction in the checkout initiation stage.
- The decline is device-specific, isolated to desktop users.
  - The timing suggests potential technical issues, layout changes, or product/pricing dissatisfaction introduced in March.
- Without intervention, desktop users—who account for two-thirds of site traffic—will continue to underperform, suppressing overall conversion rates.

#### Recommended Actions:
- Audit for bugs or layout changes that may have confused users or added extra steps.
- Conduct usability testing with desktop cohorts to simplify the search-to-checkout flow.
- Segment by browser/OS to detect whether issues are isolated to specific environments.
- Benchmark against competitor pricing and introduce promotions or bundles to re-stimulate purchase intent.
- Identify whether specific segments (e.g., new vs. returning users) were disproportionately affected.
- Retarget cart abandoners with personalized offers to recover potential revenue.


### Gender

Stable Gender Balance: Across all four months, website visitors were evenly split between male and female users.

<img width="441" height="241" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3d5f368b-2c76-4083-af6d-325eb321b1ee" />

#### Home -> Search
<img width="940" height="445" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/68be8984-2668-482e-96db-24d54d3e7208" />

#### Search -> Payment
<img width="940" height="438" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/631ff66c-f20e-42a2-bb0d-11c921379d6f" />

- Consistent Funnel Performance: Gender distribution remained broadly consistent across each funnel stage, with only marginal differences observed – Conversion challenges are not gender-driven; drop-offs are more likely linked to usability, product appeal, or pricing rather than demographic imbalance.
  - Maintain monitoring of gender trends, but prioritize device-specific usability fixes and product/pricing strategies

#### Search to Payment Overall Percentage:
<img width="940" height="85" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/455785f2-297e-4dee-9149-59cb79bdb2e8" />

#### Payment to Confirmation Overall Percentage:
<img width="940" height="102" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1ba50185-7164-4da9-8648-ddf084306106" />

- Slight Female Advantage: Female users show a marginally higher click-through rate (CTR) than males at key funnel stages:
  - Search → Payment: 14% vs. 13%
  - Payment → Confirmation: 7% vs. 6%
- While the uplift is modest (~1%), it suggests female users may be slightly more likely to progress through the funnel compared to males.

Recommended Actions:
- Validation Through Testing: Conduct targeted A/B experiments with gender-specific messaging, product positioning, or promotional offers to determine whether this uplift can be amplified.
- Segmentation Potential: If female CTR responds positively, deeper segmentation strategies (e.g., tailored campaigns or product bundles) could be justified.
- Resource Allocation: If testing shows no meaningful uplift, gender should be deprioritized as a lever, and focus should shift to higher-impact factors such as age, device type, or product category.

Gender differences in CTR are present but modest. They warrant testing, not immediate investment. The priority remains addressing device-driven usability issues and product / pricing appeal, which have shown far greater impact on funnel performance.

## **How can we Capitalise on Increasing the CTR Rate?**
<img width="940" height="546" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8193da66-ea33-4b33-8aea-26544e24221f" />

- Overall Increase: Website visitors rose by 10% in February.
- Device Contribution: Growth was evenly driven by both desktop and mobile users, each increasing by 10%.
- Demographic Contribution: Engagement also rose equally among male and female users, each up by 10%.

#### Implications
- The balanced growth across devices and demographics suggests a broad-based uplift, not isolated to a single segment.
- The timing points to external drivers such as promotions, marketing campaigns, or seasonal factors.
- While CTR remains a critical metric, visitor volume is equally important for driving sales. Sustained growth in traffic will amplify the impact of CTR improvements.

#### Recommended Actions
- Campaign Analysis: Review promotions and marketing initiatives active in February to identify what drove the uplift.
- Channel Expansion: Increase reach by diversifying into additional marketing channels (e.g., social media ads, influencer partnerships, affiliate programs).
- CTR + Traffic Strategy: Balance efforts between raising CTR and expanding visitor volume, ensuring both funnel entry and progression are optimized.
- Benchmarking: Compare February’s campaigns against competitor activity to validate effectiveness and identify missed opportunities.

## **Recommendations**
### Marketing
- Expand reach: Increase ad spend and diversify into new channels (social, affiliates, influencers) to grow visitor volume.
- Targeted promotions: Run sales, bundles, and seasonal campaigns to boost CTR from search → payment.
- Segmentation tests: Conduct A/B testing with gender-specific or demographic-tailored messaging to validate uplift opportunities.
- Re-engagement: Deploy email and retargeting campaigns for users lost in March, especially cart abandoners.
### Product
- Assortment review: Audit product availability and pricing changes in March to ensure competitiveness.
- Benchmarking: Compare against competitor offerings and adjust bundles or promotions accordingly.
- Appeal optimization: Highlight popular products more prominently in search results to stimulate purchase intent.
- Customer insights: Collect demographic data (e.g., age cohorts) to identify satisfaction gaps and refine product positioning.
### Website Management
- Mobile search audit: Investigate March breakdown (bugs, indexing errors, broken links) and restore CTR to ≥60%.
- Desktop checkout usability: Simplify search → payment flow, reduce steps, and ensure clear calls-to-action.
- Technical monitoring: Segment by browser/OS to detect isolated issues; run heatmaps and A/B tests to pinpoint friction.
- Continuous testing: Implement monthly funnel diagnostics to catch usability regressions early.
### Finance
- Benchmarking: Track CTR and conversion rates against industry averages (conversion ≥1%).
- ROI analysis: Evaluate cost per acquisition (CPA) across devices and campaigns to prioritize spend.
- Scenario planning: Model revenue impact of restoring CTR to pre-March levels (e.g., +5K mobile users, +2K desktop users monthly).
- Investment focus: Allocate budget toward high-return fixes (mobile search, desktop checkout) before scaling promotions.
